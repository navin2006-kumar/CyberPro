# Network Security Lab

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Capture network packets
- Analyze traffic patterns
- Use network diagnostic tools
- Detect anomalies

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Through Portal
1. Login at http://localhost:3000
2. Go to Labs → Network Security
3. Click "Launch Lab"

### Direct Launch
```powershell
cd labs/network-security
docker-compose up -d
```

Open: http://localhost:8082

## 🛠️ Features

- **Packet Capture** - Capture live network traffic
- **Ping Tool** - Test connectivity
- **Interface Info** - View network interfaces
- **Traffic Analysis** - Analyze captured packets

## 🎓 Learning Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Capture (15 min)
1. Start packet capture
2. Generate some traffic (ping, browse)
3. Stop capture
4. View captured packets

### Exercise 2: Traffic Analysis (20 min)
1. Capture traffic while using other labs
2. Identify protocols (HTTP, Modbus, etc.)
3. Analyze packet patterns
4. Look for anomalies

### Exercise 3: Network Diagnostics (15 min)
1. Check network interfaces
2. Ping different hosts
3. Analyze response times
4. Troubleshoot connectivity

## 💡 Tips

- **Capture Duration** - Don't capture too long (large files)
- **Filter Traffic** - Focus on specific protocols
- **Save Captures** - Download for offline analysis
- **Host Mode** - Runs in host network for full visibility
