# Rebuild Pentest Lab Container

## Quick Rebuild Commands

Run these commands to rebuild the pentest lab with the updated tools:

```powershell
# Navigate to pentest lab directory
cd "C:\Users\navin\OneDrive\문서\MY cyber\CyberPro\My Cyber pro\labs\pentest"

# Stop current containers
docker-compose down

# Rebuild the attacker container (this will install iproute2 and other tools)
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Start the lab again
docker-compose up -d
```

## What Was Added

The Dockerfile now includes:
- ✅ **iproute2** - Provides the `ip` command for network configuration
- ✅ **iptables** - For firewall and packet filtering
- ✅ **ca-certificates** - For SSL/TLS connections

## Available Network Commands

After rebuilding, you'll have these commands in the attacker terminal:

### Check Network Configuration
```bash
ip a                    # Show all network interfaces and IP addresses
ip addr show            # Same as above
ip route                # Show routing table
```

### Other Useful Commands
```bash
ifconfig                # Legacy network interface tool (from net-tools)
netstat -tulpn          # Show listening ports
ping 172.25.0.50        # Test connectivity to DVWA
ping 172.25.0.60        # Test connectivity to Juice Shop
traceroute 172.25.0.50  # Trace route to target
```

### Discovery Script
```bash
discover.sh             # Shows all targets and quick commands
```

## Verification

After rebuilding, access the attacker terminal and run:
```bash
ip a
```

You should see output showing your network interfaces including the `172.25.0.10` IP address on the lab network.
